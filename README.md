# Hii Everyone

### `Leverage these repository to build the foundation of computer science.`
## UseCases
* Interview Preparation
* DSA Revision
* Different Algorithmic Approaches
* Theoritcal Concepts
* DSA real use case
* Core CS Subjects

## Description
This repository persists the list of solutions of common data-structures &amp; algorithms problems that helps us to crack the coding interview, I tried to solve the problems in a way that we are building the concept from zero to advance with one generic approach for every concept, 
Basically here we are trying to master hidden roadmap.dsa.patterns inside in any problem instead of mastering any type of problem.

If you find this library useful please rate it by marking <b>_star_ :) Happy Coding!</b>

### `CRUX : It is wise to just understand pattern's and concept's, No of problems doesn't matter`
