# DSA-Revision
This repository persists the list of solutions of common data-structures &amp; algorithms problems that helps us to crack the coding interview, I tried to solve the problems in a way that we are building the concept from zero to advance with one generic approach for every concept, 
Basically here we try to master hidden dsa.patterns inside in any problem instead of mastering any type of problem.

If you find this library useful please rate it by marking star :) Happy Coding!
