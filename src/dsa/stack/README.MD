# Stack Patterns

### This package comprises of stack data structure related problems

* Solved only patterns consuming problems
* Pattern consuming problems means (One parent problem through which we can multiple children problems)

Objective : To develop an ability by understanding patterns.



### ```Identification Of Stack Based Question (Pattern)```

Normal feature
* If problem is on array or list kind of

Contrasting feature
* During problem solving in brute force approach if you are using nested loops
* And inner loop is dependant on outer loop 
* There is 99% chance of we can utilized stack datastructure to optimized the solution

## ``` Summary : ```
```
1) Array based problem 
2) Inner loop Dependency on outer loop
```

Above 2 feature we can use to check if question is based on stack or not
other understanding we will get by solving more problems :)
